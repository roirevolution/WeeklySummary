# Github Weekly Summary Generator

This tool can be used to generate a Markdown File containing the last 7 days of closed pull requests for the `roirevolution` organization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Fetch dependencies `mix deps.get`
3. Build the escript `mix escript.build`

You may need to update elixir and dependecies. These things seem to do that:

1. `brew upgrade elixir`
2. `env MIX_ENV=dev mix deps.get`

Also, if you encounter this, answer with `Y`:

```
Mix requires Hex >= 0.14.0 but you have 0.13.2
Shall I abort the current command and update Hex? [Yn] Y
```

### Github Access Token

You will need a Github access token that has access to the organization you are fetching pull request information for.

You can generate this token in [your Github setting](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

This `access_token` is accessed via an environmental variable. You can `export` it or specify it when running the script.

## Running

```bash
# Set the environmental variable
export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="MY_TOKEN"
./weekly_summary ORGANIZATION_NAME

# Set at run time
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=MY_TOKEN ./weekly_summary ORGANIZATION_NAME
```

### Options

#### Number of Days

By default, the last 7 days of closed Pull Requests will be fetched. This can be customized with the `--num-days` argument.

```bash
# last 7 days
./weekly_summary ORGANIZATION_NAME

# yesterday
./weekly_summary --num-days 1 ORGANIZATION_NAME

# last 30 days
./weekly_summary --num-days 30 ORGANIZATION_NAME
```

#### Specifying Date Range

You can also specify the `start-date` and `end-date`. Dates are expected to be in the format `YYYYMMDD`. If you only include `start-date` the `end-date` is today.

```bash
# start date is 2018-01-01
# end date is today
./weekly_summary --start-date 20180101 ORGANIZATION_NAME

# start date is 2017-12-25
# end date is 2017-01-31
./weekly_summary --start-date 20171225 --end-date 20170131 ORGANIZATION_NAME

```

### Outputting to Another File

By default, the Weekly Summary is printed to `stdout`. This script is most useful to run and redirect ourput to a file

```bash
./weekly_summary > this_week.md
```
